       <h3>Cruel Summer</h3>
       <p>The song cruel summer reminded me of those times when you didn't yet confess your feelings to me. The line "Fever dream high in the quiet of the night" so fever dream means nightmare and i actually relate it to me, why? because love, i'm your greatest nightmare that time, i gave you mixed signals, gave you hoped that i like you but in reality i don't, i gave you my shirt just so you would get confused if i like you or not. “You Know What I Caught” You knew that i caught your heart, you knew that you cannot escape from me, you knew it would be hard for you to move on from me, You knew what i caught. At first, that's what I thought, But no. It was you who caught me, it was you who captured me, my attention, my whole being, my thoughts, my mind, it was you. It was you the whole time. “Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes ”I like this line a lot, because I'm the devil that rolled the dice, you’re the angel that rolled their eyes on my lies, when I lied in my replies. For me cruel summer described our situation when I haven't yet confessed my attraction to you, and to my satisfaction when our interaction widened because of my actions when I confessed my attraction.
