    <h2> I like You</h2>
    <p> I'm not the type of person who flirts with someone who I know likes me and gives mixed signals; sure, I jokingly flirt with our friends, but when it comes to people who like me, I don't do that unless I have a little feelings for that person; I hate mixed signals; I'm sorry if I gave you mixed signals; I was confused, and regarding the things you've confessed in the night, I was so sure that I don't like you, but things changed Kylle. I'm not sure how or when it happened, but one day I woke up and the first person who came into my mind at 4 a.m. was you, and all I could think about was you, and you became so beautiful in my eyes, I mean don't get me wrong you've always been beautiful but, FUCK your beauty was so fucking unexplainable just like the jealousy that I feel whenever you get shipped with someone, and I started to observe your actions, the little details, I can't recall when I first began looking for you among the crowd.</p>
    <h2> Im In Love With You</h2>
    <p> I haven't formally declared my love for you, I just told you that I love you, but I haven't told you that I am in love with you kylle, and you deserve to know how in love I am with you, so here it is, I am in love with you kylle, in fact in love is an underestimate and no words can describe this feeling but I know for sure that this feeling is euphoric, raw, strong, my feelings for you are over the moon. The line "Because my love for you is higher than words." from an arabic poem literally describes how I feel rn, no words can describe this kylle, at first I was confused, then I admitted that I like you, and I told myself that maybe in 2-4 months I would fall in love with you, but it happened faster and earlier than I expected. Alexis Kylle, I'm madly in love with you.</p>
    <h2>Your Confession That Stopped The Time</h2>
    <p>Your confession that stopped the time, a confession that made me feel excited, a confession that made me feel things, a confession that made me smile, that made my heart beat so fast, a confession that I waited but surprised me and caught me off guard; a confession that I waited and yet prayed that you won't send it and keep it to yourself; a confession that made me question things. There's a part of me that waited for your confession, and there's a part of me that hoped you'd not confess. Your confession was the confession that I was scared to read, but I've read it anyway, and I questioned myself what did you see of me that made you like me.  </p>
    <h2>Could Not Reciprocate</h2>
    <p>At first I could not reciprocate your feelings towards me, and I told you that, I don't like you a bit, I only liked you as a friend, never in a single moment of my life have I imagined you as my partner or me liking you cause it seemed so impossible, and I was so sure, but then I saw you in a Monday morning, I felt nothing but nervousness and awkwardness, I was a coward for not facing nor talking to you, I was not a woman of my word when I said that nothing will change in our friendship even if you confessed your feelings to me. Something did change, the way I looked at you, the way I think of you, the way I miss you, the way I always look for you in a crowd of people, how your smile you make me smile, how your eyes can burn me, the way you made me smile, you made me smile in a way I thought you could not do, not in this lifetime or in the next. It changed how I don't care who you date, to I fucking care who you date, who you touch, who you lean to, who you tell your problems, the unexplainable jealousy that I've felt. </p>
    <h2>Things Changed</h2>
    <p>Things changed, my feelings for you changed; everything has changed. The way I feel changed, I started to question my feelings for you, you started to make me feel excited, I looked forward to seeing you in school everyday, I looked forward seeing you smile, I looked forward on feeling your presence,I looked forward on spending time with you, I started to crave your attention, I started to like you voice, your eyes, your hair, your nose, your skin, your hands, the sound of your laugh, the way you talk, the way you act, the way you do things, the way you take care of me, I started to like you and I didnt even notice it.</p>
    <h2>I Didnt Noticed</h2>
    <p>I didn't even notice that you had begun to enchant me with a quick glimpse. that your voice, your laugh, your eyes, your stare, your touch, your presence, your beauty and grace had cast an unbreakable spell on me. So, how could I notice that I was starting to like you?. Days have passed since you confessed and i also started to realized how in denial i am with my feelings for you, so I decided to accept it. I planned on confessing my feelings towards you on your birthday, but the urge was so strong that I couldn't control it. So, i told you everything, every hidden meaning of my confusing actions towards you, every confusing words and remarks i've said. I was so happy that i was not too late, i was so afraid of the thought that you might move on from me and i didnt like that.</p>
    <h2>The Day After I confessed</h2>
    <p>the day after I confessed, I was afraid to face you because I didn't know what to say to you, and then I saw you sitting in our classroom next to Rachelle looking so beautiful, there was a bit of awkwardness but I ignored it. Days passed, i started to get to know you better, i started to know your flaws, your insecurities, your attitude, your likes and dislikes, the things you want, the things you want to achieve, your dreams that you thought would be impossible to achieve, i memorized them all. </p>
    <h2>Weeks Passed</h2>
    <p>Weeks passed and I noticed that I was already falling for you. One morning I woke up so in love with you and i didnt know what to do about it, I didn't know how it happened. I just woke up one morning and you were the first and only person who i think whenever i read poems, listen to love songs, when i go to a place i love, to some place peaceful, I noticed it when you're the last person who I think of every time before I sleep, everytime i wake up. I began to love and fall in love with the things that I like about you. My feelings for you were so strong and so intense, so full they could counter harsh waves, and I could fill oceans with what I feel for you. The words you spoke, and the way you looked at me, the feeling of your skin, the warmth of your hugs. The things we laughed about, the silent moments we shared. </p>
    <h2>Every thought of mine shouts your name</h2>
    <p>Every thought of mine shouts your name, every beat of my heart speaks your name and only yours. My heart is humming your name. This, in my opinion, is what love entails. This, in my opinion, is what it is to be alive. You became my sustenance, you are half my soul as the poet says. You became the peace that I crave in this chaotic world. When I'm with you, everything that's bothering me disappears, and for the first time, I feel at peace. I always wonder why everything in my life is so pointless without you. How can I tell you that I need you?. I perceive you in artwork, beautiful things like sunsets and sunrises, stars, and love songs. You are not hard to love, what's hard is not loving you. A day never felt that long until i spent it without you, a week never felt that long until i spent it without you, a month never felt that long until i spent it without you. I love you.</p>
